# twitch-to-live2dexapi
A compact webpage/javascript file that connects Twitch to Live2DViewerEx. 

Your Twitch viewers can now remotely change your Live2D Model!

## How to Use
- After setting up the userdata.js file, open up the .html file in a browser of your choice! 
- To make things even more smooth, add it as a custom Browser Dock in OBS so you can keep monitoring it!

## How to Setup userdata.js
- Detailed instructions are in userdata.js .
- After you've logged into Twitch, create an Authentication token for this program by going to https://twitchapps.com/tokengen/ and manually generating a key.
- (The Client ID is an App code which I have already setup, but you can create your own in the Twitch Developer site at https://dev.twitch.tv .)
- Set up your channel point rewards and file locations. Sample entries are already in the file.
- That's it, have fun!
